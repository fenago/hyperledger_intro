In this exercise you will learn how to setup the cryptogen config yaml file

1.  Take the existing crypto-config.yaml file (~/HLF*/cryptogen/simple-two-org) and copy it (name it new-crypto-config.yaml) and then extend it to create the crypto for a new Organization.  Name the organization something unique (Not budget.com).  Use the existing Org as a template.

2.  Generate the crypto material by calling:

cryptogen generate --help     #to get the syntax

cryptogen generate --config ./new-crypto-config.yaml

3. Validate that the crypto material was created for the organizations by going into the generated crypto-config DIRECTORY and then navigate to peerOrganizations.  Explore the various directories
